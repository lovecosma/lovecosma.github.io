Going into this project, I was almost certain that I would catalogue some musical information. The more I thought though, the more I realized that this would be the perfect opportunity to shine a light on a equally important part of my life. I am a tarot reader and scholar. I consult my tarot cards at least once a week or more if I am going through a particularly trying time. I know not the exact mechanics of how tarot works, but I am definitely convinced that that it has more to offfer than mere confirmation bias. Each tarot card represents a archetypal instance in which all humans come into contact with at some time or another in their human experience. Being able to "read tarot" means that you can interpret the symbolic meaning of a person's "spread" in the context of their life. For instance, someone who has just embarked on a new journey may find it eerily curious that The Fool appears in their spread. Someone  waiting for the callback for a job interview can achieve peace of mind when they draw the 6 of wands. However, it seems the cards(or rather the archetypes therein) have a mind of their own (cite quantum mechanics). They will send conflicting messages and toy with the fact that you "know" what's going to happen but you don't *know* what's going to happen. 
I'm not as good as some readers out there, but there are tarot readers really make you question the way this universe really works ðŸ˜‰
